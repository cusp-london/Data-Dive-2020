# What is driving the observed inequalities within public perception of the police?  
## CUSP London Data Dive 2020

Certain groups (i.e., BAME & LGB groups) are far less positive towards the police across many different measures within MOPAC surveys (i.e., Confidence, fair treatment, Trust).  Can we glean new insights into these perception gaps,  and can wider societal data provide clues as to the decline?
